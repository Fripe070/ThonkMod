# Thonk Mod

### About
ThonkMod is a simple mod by me to learn my way around modding [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) 
using the [Forge MDK](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/).

### Playing
To use the mod, go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/TechnoShip123/ThonkMod/releases/latest) and download the
mod `.jar`, listed under assets. It should be `thonkmod-X.X.X.jar` or similar. Once you download it, make sure you
have installed the [Forge Modloader](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/). It will have
generated a `mods` folder in your `.minecraft` directory. Drag the ThonkMod `.jar` file into the mods folder, and 
start playing with the Forge Minecraft profile! Make sure that you are playing on the correct Minecraft version,
this mod is currently for [Forge 1.17.1](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.17.1.html)
or later.
#### Localization Notice
The mod may include language files for languages other than American English (en-us). However, keep in mind that 
_translations may not be 100% accurate_. If you spot an incorrect translation and want to help make it accurate, 
please open an issue rather than a pull request.

### License
I have opted for the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2.1 which states:

For the full license, see the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/TechnoShip123/ThonkMod/blob/master/LICENSE/) available

### Contribution
Since this mod is mostly just for self-learning rather than actual gameplay purposes, I am not really open to pull 
requests. However, I may consider some depending on the proposed changes, but they must target the 
[ThonkMod/dev](https://github.com/TechnoShip123/ThonkMod/tree/dev) branch. If you have a translation fix in mind, 
please open an issue with your proposed changes rather than a pull request. 

TL;DR you may open PR's, just don't expect
them to be accepted into the repository.
